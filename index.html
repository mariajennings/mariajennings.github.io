<i>You can read about one woman's quest to read a book from all 196 countries in one year <a href="https://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/thelist/">here.</a> This website is great in that it has an extensive list of books set in countries from around the globe, including those from which books can be difficult to find. I do think that the list of books could be better spaced out, and use images and block-level HTML elements to create a cleaner UI.</i>
